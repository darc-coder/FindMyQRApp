# FindMyQRApp
##### Find My QR App goal is to help you find your lost items.

> The `Main Idea` is that You will create a QR for Yourself which will contain information that you provide, (e.g Email Address).

> You can then paste those QR codes on your items.

> Now suppose, If you lost your item and someone finds it then they can scan the QR and they can view the Information that you provided.

[The Project itself is a Installable Progressive Web App.](https://findmyqr.netlify.app/ "FindMyQR App")
